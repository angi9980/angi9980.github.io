            <img src = "../img/me_makeup.jpeg" alt ="" class = "main">
            <p>I am currently a student attending the University of Colorado - Boulder majoring in Strategic Advertising.</p>
            <p>I have been a cultivator of creativity for as long as I can remember. My passion for artistic design has manifested itself in a range of media; from traditional artmaking to graphic design, I now invest my time in experimenting with Adobe Creative Cloud. This is why I am pursuing a BS in Strategic Communication and two minors in Philosophy and Creative Technology & Design at the University of Colorado Boulder.</p>
            <p>Outside of working in conjunction with taking classes, I am working to expand my connections with other creatives. I am seeking experience in the strategic or creative advertising field where I can offer my skills and vision to the companyâ€™s mission as I grow my professional portfolio.</p>
